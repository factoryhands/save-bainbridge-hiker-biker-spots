Dear Mr. Banman,

      I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern and to appeal the recent decision to change the hiker/biker sites at Fay Bainbridge Park Campground to reservable sites. As an avid outdoor enthusiast and frequent visitor to this beautiful park, I strongly believe that this decision will have a negative impact on the camping experience for hikers and bikers, and I kindly request a reconsideration of this policy change.

      Fay Bainbridge Park Campground has always been known for its welcoming and inclusive nature, providing an affordable and accessible camping option for individuals who prefer to explore the park by foot or bike. The hiker/biker sites have been a cherished feature for many years, attracting outdoor enthusiasts from various backgrounds who enjoy the simplicity and camaraderie of these communal sites. The ability to arrive spontaneously, without the need for a reservation, has been a key factor in fostering a sense of adventure and exploration that is intrinsic to the camping experience.

      By converting the hiker/biker sites to reservable sites, the park risks alienating a significant portion of its user base. Many hikers and bikers rely on the flexibility of these sites, as their itineraries can change due to unpredictable weather conditions or unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, by requiring reservations, the park may inadvertently discourage impromptu visits and discourage those who are unable to secure a reservation due to high demand or limited availability.

      Moreover, the hiker/biker sites have historically facilitated a strong sense of community among outdoor enthusiasts. Strangers would gather around campfires, share stories and experiences, and create lasting connections. This unique aspect of the campground experience would be greatly diminished if these sites were converted to reservable sites. The spontaneity and camaraderie that are fostered by hiker/biker sites contribute to the park's vibrant and inclusive atmosphere, which I believe should be preserved and celebrated.

      In light of these concerns, I respectfully request that you reconsider the decision to change the hiker/biker sites at Fay Bainbridge Park Campground to reservable sites. I understand the desire to streamline operations and provide additional amenities, but it is crucial to balance these goals with the needs and preferences of the park's diverse user base. Exploring alternative solutions, such as designating a portion of the campground as reservable while keeping some hiker/biker sites available on a first-come, first-served basis, could help strike a balance between convenience and inclusivity.

      Thank you for your time and consideration. I sincerely hope that you will take into account the voices of those who value the unique experiences provided by the hiker/biker sites at Fay Bainbridge Park Campground. Preserving these sites as they are would ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the unspoiled beauty and sense of adventure that the park has to offer.

      I would be more than willing to discuss this matter further or provide any additional information that may assist in the reconsideration process. Please do not hesitate to reach me at [Phone Number] or [Email Address]. I eagerly await a favorable response and remain optimistic that our concerns will be taken into serious consideration.

      Yours sincerely,
